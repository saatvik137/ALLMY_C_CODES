/*
Simulate a multi-player gaming environment for throwing a dice. The game rules are
as follows:
a. Initialise the game with ‘n’ players and store the details of each player such as
name in the list.
b. In the first round, all the players get fair chance to play the game. So, each one
gets one chance.
c. The turn of the player to play the game depends on the how the player
performs in the previous round, i.e. In the second round, the winner of the first
round gets to play first, followed by the one in second spot and so on.
d. From the second round, the player who scores the least is eliminated and
deleted from the system.
e. The game goes on until a winner is found.
